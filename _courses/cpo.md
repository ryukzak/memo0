This course is designed for master students and purposes for the following goals: overview and organize knowledge in computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, etc. The course's main topic is the computational process as a goal of computer system design, development, production, and utilization.

The course consists of lecture and laboratory parts. In the lectures, the students get computational organization problem statements, knowledge about different methods of computation process descriptions and computational machine organizations, and analysis in different practical applications, their features, and disadvantages. The students take the practical experience with different technologies, tools, and approaches to get hands-on experience in laboratory work.

Course prerequisites: a basic understanding of computer organization, basic skills in structured or object-oriented programming, common understanding of data structures and algorithms, and software developing tools and workflow.
