title: Computational Process Organisation
description: How to describe computational process in a different way?
---

I designed this course for master's students and purposed for the following goals: to extend their abilities by showing other ways to organise or program a computation process, and computer system design as a holistic multilevel process.

The course consists of lecture and laboratory parts. In the lectures, the students get computational organisation problem statements, knowledge about different methods of computation process descriptions and computational machine organisations, and analysis of different practical applications, their features, and disadvantages. The students take practical experience with different technologies, tools, and approaches to get hands-on experience in laboratory work.

Course prerequisites:

- basic skills in structured or object-oriented programming,
- a common understanding of data structures and algorithms,
- and software developing tools and workflow.

Based on this course, I working on the following book: [Other Ways of Programming](http://leanpub.com/other-ways-of-programming).
