## Bio

Most of the time, my work involves a blend of research (finding and verifying hypotheses, finding new point of view), development (architecting, implementing, and managing projects), and teaching (delivering lectures, providing consulting services, and mentoring). I specialize in various aspects of software engineering. Here are a few examples of my experiences:

- Developing the certification-compliant electricity measurement system for small towns.
- Authoring the Ph.D. thesis on the architecture of multi-level computer systems, exploring how system levels interact across configuration, compilation, interpretation stages, and between software and hardware components.
- Founding the CAD platform tailored for hard-real-time application-specific processors.
- Architecting, developing, and managing the research project focused on planning systems for distributed manufacturing with restricted access to production documentation.

<!-- Third Person Bio: Aleksandr Penskoi, Ph.D., is working as Associate Professor at Software Engineering and Computer Systems Faculty at ITMO University with a specialization in computational process modeling and computer system design. The primal research topics are multi-level computer systems, hard real-time reconfigurable application-specific processors (NITTA), and verification. He has experience in real-world development as an architect and software engineer, e.g., electricity measuring system for small towns with certification. -->

## My Topics / Мои темы

I can serve as your advisor in various theoretical and technical domains:

### Theoretical Topics

1. Data Modeling: Learn how to effectively represent domain-specific data, formalize it, and interpret it. Discover methods to seamlessly integrate data models into software systems.
1. Architectural Design: Explore techniques for visualizing system architecture and leveraging architectural descriptions within the design and implementation processes.
1. Systems Engineering: Gain insights into holistic system understanding, identifying critical components and questions, and assessing the overall quality of your system.
1. Engineering Methods: Understand how to approach the development process methodologically but simple, and navigate project management challenges when everything seems to go awry.

### Technical Topics

1. Functional Programming: Explore alternative approaches to software development that revolve around functional programming principles. Applying it to real projects.
1. Domain-Specific Languages: Discover how to streamline the programming process and understand why Domain-Specific Languages may not always be the best solution. eDSL intergation in the host language.
1. Distributed Systems: Learn the best practices for designing and implementing distributed systems, taking into account specific business requirements.
1. Software Verification: How do you make sure that the system developed meets expectations? How do I formulate these expectations?

Please feel free to explore my projects to get a better idea of my expertise and how I can assist you.
